The DriverPass project involved working with a client named DriverPass, who wanted a system to help people prepare for their driving exams. Their request included an online platform that would allow students to take practice tests, access study materials, and schedule behind-the-wheel training sessions with instructors, as well as provide administrators with tools for managing users, courses, and scheduling. One area I did particularly well on this project was gathering and organizing the client’s requirements into a clear and structured business requirements document. This helped lay a strong foundation for the system design. I also feel I did well in identifying the different user roles—students, administrators, and instructors—and showing through use cases how each role would interact with the system.

If I were to revise one part of my work, I would focus on improving the system design diagrams. While they captured the overall structure and interactions, I believe they could be made more detailed and consistent in formatting to enhance readability and professionalism for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. When designing the system, I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing their goals. For example, the client wanted to provide both practice exams and real-world training opportunities, so I included features for online testing as well as a scheduling system to connect students with instructors. It is essential to consider user needs in any design, because if those needs are ignored, the final product may not solve the client’s problems or meet their expectations.

In general, my approach to designing software is to begin with clear requirements gathering and then move step by step into analysis and modeling. I like to use diagrams such as use case, activity, and class diagrams to visualize the system before considering implementation details. Looking forward, I want to focus more on iterative design—breaking projects into smaller phases, collecting feedback early, and improving continuously. I also plan to use techniques such as prototyping and user stories to ensure that my future designs align closely with client and user expectations.
